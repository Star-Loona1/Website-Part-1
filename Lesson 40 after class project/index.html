        <h2 style="text-align: center;">K-POP GROUPS</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">K-pop groups are a wide variety of musical ensembles from South Korea, with prominent examples including BTS, BLACKPINK, and EXO. Other popular groups include TWICE, Stray Kids, and SEVENTEEN. There are also numerous girl groups, boy groups, and "supergroups" like SuperM which are active at various times. K-pop groups are trained in an "idol trainee" system, blending Korean and Western musical styles with a focus on synchronized choreography, visuals, and diverse vocal/rap skills. Groups are structured with members holding specific positions like "main" or "lead" vocalist, dancer, or "visual" to create a complementary dynamic. Prominent groups include BTS and Blackpink (third generation) and EXO (also third generation), while new groups like NCT(which has 23 members) and Stray Kids continue to build global appeal.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: center; background-color: navy; color: lavender; padding: 90px 80px; margin-bottom: 0%;">BTS, also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band formed in 2010. The band consists of Jin, Suga, J-Hope,
        RM, Jimin, V, and Jung Kook, who co-write or co-produce much of their material.</h3>
        <hr>
        <p style="text-align: center; background-color: goldenrod; letter-spacing: 1px; padding: 50px;">BTS debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment with the single album 2 Cool 4 Skool. BTS released their first Korean and Japanese-language studio albums, Dark & Wild and Wake Up respectively, in 2014. The group's second Korean studio album, Wings (2016), was their first to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS had crossed into the global music market and led the Korean Wave into the United States, becoming the first Korean ensemble to receive a Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for their single "Mic Drop", as well as the first act from South Korea to top the Billboard 200 with their studio album Love Yourself: Tear (2018). In 2020, BTS became the fastest group since the Beatles to chart four US number-one albums in less than two years, with Love Yourself: Answer (2018) becoming the first Korean album certified Platinum by the RIAA; in the same year, they also became the first all-South Korean act to reach number one on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard Global 200 with their Grammy-nominated single "Dynamite". Follow-up releases "Savage Love", "Life Goes On", "Butter", "Permission to Dance", and "My Universe" made them the fastest act to earn six US number-one singles since the Beatles in 1966.</p>

    <h3 style="background-color: rebeccapurple; color: mediumturquoise; padding: 90px 80px; text-align: center;">Enhypen is a South Korean boy band formed by Belift Lab. Formerly a joint venture between CJ ENM and Hybe Corporation, the group was formed through the 2020 survival competition show I-Land. The group consists of seven members: Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo, Jungwon, and Ni-Ki. They debuted on November 30, 2020, with the extended play (EP) Border: Day One.</h3><hr>

    <p style="background-color: tomato; padding: 70px; letter-spacing: 1px; color: cornsilk;">The name Enhypen was introduced during the live broadcast of the final episode of I-Land. Etymologically, the group derives their name from the hyphen symbol (-), representing "Connection, Discovery, & Growth".[5] Similar to how a hyphen connects different words to create new meanings, Enhypen aims "to come together to connect, discover and grow together to form a new act".[2][6][7] In March 2019, Belift Lab was co-founded by South Korean entertainment agencies CJ E&M and Hybe Corporation, with plans to create a new band in 2020.[8] Auditions commenced the same month in Seoul, the United States, Taiwan, and Japan, among others locations, seeking male trainees born between 1997 and 2008.[9][10][11] On May 8, 2020, television channel Mnet announced the survival competition series I-Land as part of the joint venture between the two entertainment companies that "follows the process of next generation K-pop artists being born".[11][12][13] Enhypen was formed through the show, which featured 23 male trainees, some of whom were originally auditioned for Belift, while others transferred from Big Hit Music. The show aired weekly on Mnet from June 26 to September 18, 2020, and internationally on Hybe Labels' YouTube channel.[14][15][16] The series was split into two parts, with the top 12 contestants from the first part advancing to the second.[14] On the last episode of the show, seven members were selected out of the nine final contestants, with six chosen by global rankings and one by producers' choice.[17][18] The final lineup of Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo, Jungwon, and Ni-Ki was announced on the live television broadcast of the finale.[19][20]

In 2023, San's "Warriors" performance video, which he co-developed and co-choreographed, received praise from OSEN for
        its "diverse choreography composition"[33] and from Single List for San's "detailed facial expressions that matched the
        mood of the song".[34][35][36]
        
        In 2024, San was credited with contributing to the choreography for the title track "Work" from the album Golden Hour:
        Part.1.[37]

        explained, “To express ‘Adrenaline’ instinctively, I focused on movements that feel like blood rushing through your
        body, like tightening the neck or showing blood flowing”.[38]
